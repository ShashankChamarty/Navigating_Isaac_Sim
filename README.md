# Navigating_Isaac_Sim  
**Work in progress (WIP)**

This repository documents my journey learning and working with **NVIDIA Isaac Sim**, with a focus on helping beginners get started without feeling overwhelmed.

The goal is to break down the *entire* process of simulating a robot—from first-time setup to running meaningful simulations—so you can iterate quickly and avoid common setup traps.

In this repository, I will cover:
- Setting up a robot from scratch in Isaac Sim  
- Core foundations such as visual meshes, joints, rigid bodies, frames, and colliders  
- Using and understanding various Isaac Sim APIs through simple, practical scripts  
- Simulation workflows: moving a robot, testing behavior, and debugging issues  
- An introduction to **Isaac Lab** and how it fits into training and experimentation  
- My overall learning journey, including lessons learned, mistakes to avoid, and practical tips
- Files and images of various examples throughout 

This is a living guide that will continue to grow as I explore more advanced features and workflows.  
If you’re new to Isaac Sim or want a clearer mental model of how everything fits together, this repository is meant for you.

Let’s get started.
