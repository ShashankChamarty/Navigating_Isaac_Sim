# Kinematics using Lula robot description

Lula Robot description is Isaac Sim's inbuilt forward and inverse kinematics calculator given that you have a .urdf and lula descirption editor's .yaml file for your specific robot articulation. 

Once you have those files, you can create spherical collisions and so on for creating the kinematic chain for optimal physics engine performance in simulation

## Step 1: Converting USD to URDF

## Step 2: Converting USD to .yaml robot description file

## Step 3: Collisions

## Forward Kinematics

## Inverse Kinematics
