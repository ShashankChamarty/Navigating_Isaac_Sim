# Kinematics using Lula robot description

Lula Robot description is Isaac Sim's inbuilt forward and inverse kinematics calculator given that you have a .urdf and lula descirption editor's .yaml file for your specific robot articulation. 

Once you have those files, you can create spherical collisions and so on for creating the kinematic chain for optimal physics engine performance in simulation

## Step 1: Converting USD to URDF

In order to convert to URDF first go to `extensions` then search for `USD to URDF converter` then toggle to `on`.

But before you could click export to URDF, you need to have prequisits in how you created the kinematic chain for your robot.

## Step 2: Converting USD to .yaml robot description file

## Step 3: Collisions

## Forward Kinematics

## Inverse Kinematics
