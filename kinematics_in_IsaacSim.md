# Kinematics using Lula robot description

Lula Robot description is Isaac Sim's inbuilt forward and inverse kinematics calculator given that you have a .urdf and lula descirption editor's .yaml file for your specific robot articulation. 

Once you have those files, you can create spherical collisions and so on for creating the kinematic chain for optimal physics engine performance in simulation

## PREREQUISITS

You already need to have the following files ready before we can move forward with using the Lula Kinematics library:
    1. A URDF file version of your robot with colliders.
    2. A .yaml robot description file.

For the above you can view other documents in this repository.
